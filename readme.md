# MAGMA Readme
## Multi-area Grid Metrics Analyzer

This package creates figures and an HTML file with all of those figures for plexos solutions.
* You must use process_folder() from the rplexos package to create a database file from the PLEXOS solution .zip, before running this code.
* The Examples folder contains templates and examples of the input data CSV, the generator name, region, and zone mapping CSV, the R script that runs the package, and example HTML reports (within the reports folder).
* Section_guide.md lists what sections correspond to each number for the sections to run column in the input data CSV file.

## To Run:
1. Copy run_html_output.R and input_data_template.csv from the Examples/ folder into another folder associated with your project specific repository.
2. Edit input_data.csv according to your model. Some of these values may be defined in run_html_output.R
3. If using a CSV to map generator name to type, create this.
4. If generation type by region or zone is wanted, add region and zone columns to mapping CSV.
5. Edit Examples/run_html_output_template.R to point to your input_data.csv and databases. You may point to multiple databases by listing a vector of database locations. Additionally, you may specify 'scenario.names' to re-name the scenario for each database. Default is the folder name. 
6. Edit run_html_output.R to set html output file name, directory and current working directory where files are located.
7. Run: ```source('run_html_output.R')```

### Notes:
1. If you have trouble with the render function, make sure the "rmarkdown" package is installed. If there are issues locating or sourcing files, make sure the appropriate working directories and paths are setup correctly.
2. You can choose to run individual chunks or the entire package. This is setup in the input_data.csv file. Running the entire package could take a long time, particularly for large solution files and if the solution file has to be processed by rplexos (done the first time MAGMA is run).
3. The name of your database file must start with "Model".
4. Report any problems or issues to Matt O'Connell or Brady Stoll at NREL. matthew.oconnell@nrel.gov or Brady.Stoll@nrel.gov

##### input_data.csv columns:
1. ref.scenario
	+ Name of reference scenario if comparing multiple solution files. Only used if more than one database is provided.
	Scenario name must be the name of the folder where the solution file is contained. Each different scenario's solution must be in its own individual folder. If multiple database solutions are provided and no ref.scenario is specified, the first one listed will default to the base or reference scenario.
2. PLEXOS.Gen.Category
	+ Categories in PLEXOS database. This must contain all the categories in your PLEXOS database.
	+ Only required if "use.gen.type.csv" or "Using.Gen.Type.Mapping.CSV" is FALSE.
3. PLEXOS.Desired.Type	
	+ Assigns a generation type to each of the PLEXOS categories.
	+ Only required if "use.gen.type.csv" or "Using.Gen.Type.Mapping.CSV" is FALSE.
4. Gen.Type
	+ All types of generation that you either assign through the CSV or PLEXOS category. It can contain more types than you currently have, but it must have all of them otherwise they will be missing from the results.
5. Plot.Color
	+ Assigns a plot color to each generation type
6. Gen.Order
	+ Assigns an order from top to bottom of generation types for dispatch stacks. This list must also contain every generation type that you assign.
7. Renewable.Types.for.Curtailment
	+ Generation types to be considered in curtailment calculations.
8. DA.RT.Plot.Types
	+ Types of generation to show in the committment and dispatch plots.
9. Key.Periods
	+ You can choose individual time spans to plot results for. This column assigns names to those time periods.
10. Start.Time
	+ Corresponding start time for each of the periods in 9.
11. End.Time
	+ Corresponding end time for each of the periods in 9. 
12. Ignore.Zones
 	+ Zones to exclude from plots
13. Ignore.Regions
	+ Regions to exclude from plots
14. Interfaces.for.Flows
	+ Specific interfaces to show flow data for
	+ If all interfaces are desired, list 'ALL' as only entry
15. Lines.for.Flows
	+ Specific lines to show flow data for
	+ If all lines are desired, list 'ALL' as only entry
16. Sections.to.Run
	+ Sections (chunks) of the HTML_output.Rmd file to run.
17. Region.Order
	+ Optional column specifying a certain order for Regions to appear in your plots. 
	+ Defaults to alphabetical
18. Zone.Order
	+ Optional column specifying a certain order for Zones to appear in your plots. 
	+ Defaults to alphabetical
19. Scenario.Names
	+ Optional columns to specify the names of your scenarios. Default is the folder name where the solution file is contained.


## Required PLEXOS outputs

PLEXOS must report the following data in order for all of the scripts to work. If you try to run a section and are missing the required data you will get an error telling you what PLEXOS output data is missing (or that the query had an error). The section_guide.md file specifies what outputs are required for each individual section. The below list is if every section was run (this can take a long time for larger databases).
